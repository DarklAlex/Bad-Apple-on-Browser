Permission is hereby granted, free of charge (yup, totally free), to any person who somehow stumbles upon  
a copy of this codebase and its assorted magical files (the “Software”), to do whatever they want with it —  
yes, literally — including but not limited to: using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing,  
distributing, sublicensing, and/or selling copies of the Software (because why not).  

Also, you're allowed to let others do all that too, as long as:  
- you don’t pretend you made it from scratch,  
- and you include this overly honest permission notice and copyright disclaimer  
  in any significant chunk of the Software you reuse or repurpose.

Now, the legal gremlins need us to say:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER —  
seriously, no guarantees, no promises, not even a polite nod.  
This includes (but is not limited to) the implied warranties of merchantability,  
fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.  

Basically, if this thing breaks your computer, eats your files, or starts printing  
"Bad Apple!!" lyrics on your tax reports, that's on you.  
The authors shall not be held liable for anything. Ever. Period.  
Use at your own risk and with appropriate levels of caffeine.

Cheers,
